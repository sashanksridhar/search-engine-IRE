'''''Younger v. Harris''''', 401 U.S. 37 (1971),{{ref|citation}} was a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that [[United States federal courts]] were required to [[abstention doctrine|abstain]] from hearing any [[civil rights]] [[tort]] claims brought by a person who is currently being [[prosecution|prosecuted]] for a matter arising from that claim.

==Facts==
A [[California]] statute prohibited advocating "unlawful acts of force or violence [to] effect political change."  The [[defendant]], Harris, was charged with violating the statute, and he sued under [[42 U.S.C. § 1983]] to get an injunction preventing District Attorney [[Evelle J. Younger]] from enforcing the law on the grounds that it violated the free speech guarantee.

==Decision and precedent==
In an 8-1 decision, the Court held that federal courts may not hear the case until the person is [[convicted]] or found not guilty of the crime unless the defendant will suffer an irreparable injury that is "both great and immediate." Merely having to endure a criminal prosecution is no such irreparable harm.

There are three exceptions to Younger abstention:
#Where the prosecution is in bad faith (i.e. the state knows the person to be innocent)—as applied in ''[[Dombrowski v. Pfister]]''; or
#Where the prosecution is part of some pattern of harassment against an individual; or
#Where the law being enforced is utterly and irredeemably unconstitutional (e.g., if the state were to pass a law making it a crime to say anything negative about its governor under any circumstances).

==Status as precedent==
The doctrine was later extended to situations where the state is seeking to execute a [[civil fine]] against someone, or has jailed a person for [[contempt of court]]. The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet taken any action on the suit. Moreover, the principle of abstention applies to some state administrative proceedings.

In regard to the exceptions which the ''Younger'' Court articulated, later decisions make it clear that these are highly difficult to meet.
#''Bad faith prosecution'': in no case since ''Younger'' was decided has the Supreme Court found there to exist bad faith prosecution sufficient to justify a federal court injunction against state court proceedings. The Court has specifically declined to find bad faith prosecution even in circumstances where repeated prosecutions had occurred. As commentator [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] states, the bad-faith prosecution exception seems narrowly limited to facts like those in ''Dombrowski''.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Chemerinsky, ''Federal Jurisdiction'' (5th ed. 2007), Aspen Publishers, p.860&lt;/ref&gt;   Other scholars have even asserted that the possible range of cases which would fit the ''Dombrowski'' model and allow an exception to the no-injunction rule is so limited as to be an "empty universe."&lt;ref&gt;Chemerinsky, p. 859-60&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Patently unconstitutional law'': in no case since ''Younger'' was decided has the Supreme court found there to exist a patently unconstitutional law sufficient to justify a federal court injunction against state court proceedings. The Court has specifically declined to find such patent unconstitutionality in at least one case (Trainor v. Hernandez) &lt;ref&gt;431 US 434 (1977), [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1976/1976_75_1407/ oyez.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Inadequate state forum'': the Supreme Court has found the state forum in question to be inadequate on a small number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975), [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1973/1973_73_477/ oyez.org]
Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564 (1973), [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1972/1972_71_653/ oyez.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Brown "Brownie" McGhee''' (November 30, 1915&amp;nbsp;– February 16, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1996–1997 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |access-date=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[folk music]] and [[Piedmont blues]] singer and guitarist, best known for his collaboration with the harmonica player [[Sonny Terry]].&lt;ref name="Music"&gt;{{cite book

==Life and career==
McGhee was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and grew up in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="amg"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dahl, Bill |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brownie-mcghee-mn0000630882/biography |title=Brownie McGhee: Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]].com |access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the age of four he contracted polio, which incapacitated his right leg. His brother [[Stick McGhee|Granville "Sticks"(or "Stick") McGhee]], who also later became a musician and composed the famous song "Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-o-Dee,"&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hwk3AgAAQBAJ&amp;q=brownie+mcghee&amp;pg=PA671 |title=The Blues Encyclopedia |page=671 |date= July 2004|isbn=9781135958312 |access-date=2016-11-08|last1=Komara |first1=Edward |last2=Lee |first2=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt; was nicknamed for pushing young Brownie around in a cart. Their father, George McGhee, was a factory worker, known around University Avenue for playing guitar and singing. Brownie's uncle made him a guitar from a tin marshmallow box and a piece of board.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Jack (1995). ''Knoxville's Secret History''. Scruffy City Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGhee spent much of his youth immersed in music, singing with a local harmony group, the Golden Voices Gospel Quartet, and teaching himself to play guitar. He also played the five-string banjo and ukulele and studied piano.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Surgery funded by the [[March of Dimes]] enabled McGhee to walk.

At age 22, McGhee became a traveling musician, working in the [[Rabbit Foot Minstrels]] and befriending [[Blind Boy Fuller]], whose guitar playing influenced him greatly. After Fuller's death in 1941, [[J. B. Long]] of [[Columbia Records]] promoted McGhee as "Blind Boy Fuller No. 2."&lt;ref name="Devil"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/190 190/2]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By that time, McGhee was recording for Columbia's subsidiary [[Okeh Records]] in Chicago, but his real success came after he moved to New York in 1942, when he teamed up with [[Sonny Terry]], whom he had known since 1939, when Terry was Fuller's harmonica player.&lt;ref name="Devil"/&gt;  The pairing was an overnight success. They recorded and toured together until around 1980.&lt;ref name="Devil"/&gt;  As a duo, Terry and McGhee did most of their work from 1958 until 1980, spending 11 months of each year touring and recording dozens of albums.&lt;ref name="LarkinBlues"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|page=262/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their later fame as "pure" folk artists playing for white audiences, in the 1940s Terry and McGhee had attempted to be successful recording artists, fronting a [[jump blues]] combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano, variously calling themselves Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers or Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five, often with [[Champion Jack Dupree]] and [[Big Chief Ellis]]. They also appeared in the original Broadway productions of ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.

During the [[Roots revival|blues revival]] of the 1960s, Terry and McGhee were popular on the concert and music festival circuits, occasionally adding new material but usually remaining faithful to their roots and playing to the tastes of their audiences.&lt;ref name="LarkinBlues"/&gt;

Late in his life, McGhee appeared in small roles in films and on television. He and Terry appeared in the 1979 [[Steve Martin]] comedy ''[[The Jerk]]''. In 1987, McGhee gave a small but memorable performance as the ill-fated blues singer Toots Sweet in the supernatural thriller movie ''[[Angel Heart]].'' In his review of ''Angel Heart'', the critic [[Roger Ebert]] singled out McGhee for praise, declaring that he delivered a "performance that proves [saxophonist] [[Dexter Gordon]] isn't the only old musician who can act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870306/REVIEWS/703060301/1023 |title=Angel Heart |author=Ebert, Roger |date= March 6, 1987 |newspaper= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGhee appeared in the television series ''Family Ties'', in a 1988 episode entitled "The Blues, Brother", in which he played the fictional blues musician Eddie Dupre. He also appeared in the television series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', in a 1989 episode entitled "The Blues Singer", playing a friend of an old blues musician ([[Joe Seneca]]) who is accused of murder. In the episode, McGhee, Seneca and star [[Andy Griffith]] perform a duet of "The Midnight Special".

[[Happy Traum]], a former guitar student of McGhee's, edited a blues guitar instruction guide and songbook, ''Guitar Styles of Brownie McGhee'', published in 1971, in which McGhee, between lessons, talked about his life and the blues. The autobiographical section features McGhee talking about growing up, his musical beginnings, and a history of the blues from the 1930s onward.

McGhee and Terry were both recipients of a 1982 [[National Heritage Fellowship]] awarded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/1982|title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships 1982 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=November 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929133224/https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/1982 |archive-date=September 29, 2020 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA.

One of McGhee's last concert appearances was at the 1995 [[Chicago Blues Festival]].&lt;ref name="amg"/&gt;

McGhee died of [[stomach cancer]] on February 16, 1996 in [[Oakland, California]], at age 80.&lt;ref name="Elwood"&gt;{{cite news |last=Elwood |first=Philip |title=Walter 'Brownie' McGhee, blues composer, performer |url=https://www.chron.com/news/article/Walter-Brownie-McGhee-blues-composer-performer-3151071.php|work=Houston Chronicle |location=Houston, Texas |date=February 19, 1996 |page=10 |access-date=November 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
